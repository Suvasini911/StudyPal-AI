🌱 Green AI Energy Intelligence
AI-Powered Energy Prediction, Cost Optimization & Carbon Reduction Platform



A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts household energy consumption, calculates carbon emissions, estimates electricity cost, and provides intelligent optimization recommendations through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.


🚨 Problem
Rising energy consumption leads to:

⚡ Higher electricity bills

🌍 Increased carbon emissions

📉 No predictive insights

❌ No intelligent optimization tools

Traditional systems only show past usage — they don’t predict or optimize.
